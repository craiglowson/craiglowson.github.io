# About this site

This is a little site that I've setup using Github Pages and using the Jekyll templates.

For now, I'm not too sure what I'm going to use this for other than getting to know Github better.

As part of that, I might put up some posts regards Python/Networking/PowerShell or anything else that I can think of, mostly as a way of generating content so that I can see how to do that on the platform.
