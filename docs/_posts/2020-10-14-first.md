# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

## About the site

This is being built on Github Pages and is using the Slate theme for Jekyll. 

There's some light customisation of the site as to include this posts section and to include some links in the footer section. These might get moved up to the header if it makes sense, though it looks like it'll depend upon how long the content within each page is (if too short, then footer looks a bit big).

Github pages seem liike they behave slightly different from the base info given on the Jekyll site, the front matter on each Markdown page sometimes doesn't play well.
