# Second post

This should be a fairly simple second post. I'm using this to check creating a branch for this new post, and then merging into the published branch that is served out by Github. 

There's not really much too this, just testing generating the PR locally that contains the new post and then <span class="myfont">merging</span> it upstream.


### Update

I've added the red bit in the text to test using a custom css file. 

When using a theme, can't seem to get the Github process to pull in extra css/scss files from within the base the scss file so I've entered an extra reference to the custom css within the default html file.
